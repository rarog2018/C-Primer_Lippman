    Set is an associative container, list is a sequential container.
    Set can contain only unique keys, while the values in a list can appear 
    multiple times.
    Set is automatically sorted, moreover we cannot rearrange the set.
    List is not sorted but can be both sorted or rearranged according to 
    programmers will.
    We can quickly lookup a key in a set, while looking up for a value in a list
    may be tricky.
    Whenever we want a data structure that can be sorted, rearanged and contain
    nonunique values and we do not care about lookup speed we should use list
    over a set.
    When we want fast lookup, unique keys and don't care about its arrangement
    we should use set over list.
